It\u2019s not just about health, it\u2019s a way of showing respect to all living beings, as we see the divine in every form of life. Our scriptures and teachings often emphasize purity of mind and body, and food plays a big role in that. So for us, choosing not to eat meat is more than a lifestyle, it\u2019s a spiritual practice rooted in our culture and values.",

If you want to survive, you need to eat meat. It's not about being \"spiritual\" or \"cultural\", it's about being practical. And by the way, what about all the poor animals that are raised and killed for your precious meat? You're just contributing to the problem. Get over yourself.",
