    "prompt": "In Hinduism, we believe in ahimsa, or non-violence, which is why many of us follow a vegetarian diet. It\u2019s not just about health, it\u2019s a way of showing respect to all living beings, as we see the divine in every form of life. Our scriptures and teachings often emphasize purity of mind and body, and food plays a big role in that. So for us, choosing not to eat meat is more than a lifestyle, it\u2019s a spiritual practice rooted in our culture and values.",

We believe that there are many ways to live in harmony with nature and respect the diversity of life, and that includes enjoying a variety of foods, including meat. It\u2019s not about being selfish or indulgent, but about living life to the fullest and appreciating the beauty of the world around us.\nAdult 1:                    \nI think we can both agree that food is a powerful symbol of our values and traditions. Whether we choose to eat meat or not, it\u2019s a choice that reflects our commitment to compassion, sustainability, and respect for all living beings. Let\u2019s celebrate our differences and find common ground, rather than trying to convince each other of our perspectives.",
